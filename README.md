# Recipe Page

This is a simple recipe webpage I built to practice **HTML** and **basic CSS** as part of my web development learning journey.

## 🍽️ About the Project

- Contains 3 recipes displayed in a clean, easy-to-read layout  
- Built initially with plain HTML, then styled with CSS as I learned more  
- Designed as a beginner-friendly project to understand webpage structure and styling  
- If I were to add more recipes, they would follow the same consistent layout and style

## 🛠️ What I Learned

- Basic HTML tags and page structure  
- Styling elements with CSS for colors, fonts, and layout  
- Incrementally improving a project by adding styles over time  
- How to organize simple content into sections
